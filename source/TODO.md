# Needed
- Refraction materials
- Not attract for non-attracted objects

# Features
- OpenMP
- Distributed computing (TCP)

# Refactoring
- Replace vec4 using as a color with special light class
- Move code from headers to modules

# Ideas for rendering
- Menger sponge
- Room with lighter above
- Refraction and caustics (maybe from wine in glass?)
- 3d fractals (mandelbox? quaternion mandelbrot set?)
- Projecting through the lens
- Liquid modelling
- Fire modelling
