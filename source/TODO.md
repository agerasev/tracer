# Neccessary!
- remove std::vector<Ray> as argument. Maube use common std::queue<Ray>? There must be one common storage.
- Do not use state as I do now.

# Refactoring
- Replace vec4 using as a color with special Light class
- Add Material class

# Ideas for rendering
- Menger sponge
- Projecting through the lens
- Difraction on the slot
- Liquid modelling
- Fire modelling
